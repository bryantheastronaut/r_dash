# R_dash: A Lodash-like utils library in Rust.
![Rusty Tools](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/rusty-tools-matusciac-alexandru.jpg)

While trying to learn Rust, I thought it may be beneficial to give myself a project to work on.
I will be attempting to write a (significantly smaller) utils libray. I use (and love) [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4)
when I write Javascript, so many of these helper methods will be stolen wholesale from their
sourcecode and re-implemented in Rust.

PR's adding new functionality are welcome!
